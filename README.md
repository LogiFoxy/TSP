# Traveling Salesman Problem with Branch and Bound assingment guidelines:
#You will need to develop the TSP algorithm with Branch and Bound and apply parallelism to achieve a better execution time of the algorithm. 
#Therefore you will need to redesign the algorithm to work with threads in order to achieve parallelism. 
#The assignment of tasks to the threads should be done in such a way as to achieve proper parallelization and to have an improvement in the performance of the algorithm. 
#In the end, the execution times with parallelism and without parallelism should be compared. 
#Also for the parallelism you should have different values regarding the threads that will be used for the parallelism e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16
